# mySetup

Philospophy/guidelines/best practices and config files I like to use to customize my development environment.  

I will also try and keep a list of folks who have inspired some of my decisions.  


## Guidlines
  
Use ESLint.  
Use Prettier.  

### ESLint setup . 
...coming soon.  

### Iterm2 Prefs

I like to title my terminal sessions so I know which is which. You can name the terminal window with the following command:

echo -ne "\033]0;"<Title here>"\007" . 

Replace <Title Here> with your title.
